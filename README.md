# TheoriesAndDataStructures
Showing how some simple mathematical theories naturally give rise to some common data-structures.

Attempting to answer the following questions:
- Why do lists pop-up more frequently to the average programmer than, say, their duals: bags?
- More simply, why do unit and void/empty types occur so naturally? What about enumerations/sums
  and records/products?
- Why is it that dependent sums and products do not pop-up to the average programmer?  
- How do we get the usual toolbox of functions and helpful combinators for a particular data type?
  Are they ``built into'' the type?
- Is it that the average programmer works in the category of classical `Sets`, with functions and
  propositional equality? Does this result in some ``free constructions'' not easily made computable
  since mathematicians usually work in the category of `Setoids` but tend to quotient to arrive in
  `Sets` ---where quotienting is not computably feasible, in `Sets` at-least; and why is that?
